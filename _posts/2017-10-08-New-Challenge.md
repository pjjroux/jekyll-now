## New challenge: Software AG Natural/ADABAS

The start of the new week marks the start of a new chapter in my programming career. I was sent on a Software AG: Natural Programming Fundamentals course last week and it was a lot of fun to learn the basics of the language and how it integrates with the SOA environment.

I received a promotion to Analyst Programmer a month ago and with that comes new responsibilities. I must learn Natural/ADABAS programming to support the basic business needs and to further work on the ERP project we are busy with. I need to be ready to jump back and forth from PHP and Natural as I will be working in both for the foreseeable future.

I left for the Software AG offices in Bryanston last week and felt overwhelmed at the sheer scale of everything in the city, having grown up in rural South Africa I was like a fish out of water. It all was next level and a bit overwhelming but I was eager to get going learning the new language. I soon realized that Natural shares a lot of features with newer languages even though it is considered a legacy programming language.

I found that even though the course was structured as a basic programming fundamentals course I learned a lot by doing the exercises after each chapter we completed as it was based on real world examples.

>Learn by doing, practice makes perfect.

The most important thing is that you learn by doing. I read all the course material but only felt real progress by coding and seeing the results first hand. Natural/ADABAS seems easy when reading the code but I still found that some concepts worked a little different than what I am used to in other programming languages.

It was interesting to see how the language evolved and I worked with the NaturalONE IDE that is based on Eclipse and it gives you the feeling that you are working with a modern language compared to working with it in the terminal. I am excited to get working in Natural/ADABAS as most of my current employer’s systems is based on the platform. I feel that I am up for the challenge and I am confident that I will be able to adapt to the nuances of Natural/ADABAS.

This is the next step in further developing and bettering myself, by keeping an open mind and learning from my seniors and colleagues I will be ready for the next step in my career…
