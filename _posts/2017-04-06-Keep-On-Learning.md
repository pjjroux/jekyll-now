title: The need to keep on learning
---
_Taking it one day at a time._

## Progress being made

The last few months have been nothing short of spectacular. I have been enjoying my work a lot and as an extra bonus this semester's studies turned out to be really interesting.

I have learned a lot in system analysis and design and I now have a better understanding of what goes into managing and planning a big project. Management Information Systems is a lot of work and I still have a way to go before the exams. Getting the bigger picture from a management perspective helps me appreciate the tremendous responsibility project managers have every day.

I am currently finishing some "nice to haves" on my VB.NET project for my semester project and learned so much from doing this project. I struggle to understand OOP fundamentals and this project helped me tremendously with basic object oriented principles.

## Object-oriented programming (OOP) and the hunger for knowledge

I now want to learn more about OOP in PHP specifically because I am used to a functional programming style and don't have much exposure to OOP. I am dabbling with Laravel because it follows a strict object oriented approach with MVC concepts.

The need to keep on learning keeps me hungry for new knowledge and skills. Studies have shown that the rate of depression is lower for adults who are actively involved in learning activities. We can make a bigger contribution by learning new and interesting skills that help us better ourselves and those around us.

When people learn, they gain confidence for trying new things and stretching themselves. In the last year, I have learned a lot from my fellow developers in a lot of different areas. Never be afraid to ask questions. I am working on a very challenging project at work and I got to a point where I was stuck in a rut, so I turned to a fellow developer for help and was back on track in record time and motivated to get going again.

Sometimes we just need that little push to get going in the right direction. The next few months will be tough with exams coming up but starting on a new project at work and I have a little Arduino project that I want to get to so that will keep things interesting.

Never stop learning and never stop dabbling with new technologies.
