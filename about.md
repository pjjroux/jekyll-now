### Knowledge is the spice of life

My name is _Jaco Roux_ and I work as a PHP developer in South Africa. I love the challenge of coding and creating new ideas daily. I am currently studying towards my National Diploma in IT.

I am an avid gamer and PC enthusiast and recently started dabbling in Linux. I am on a quest to learn as much as I can throughout my life and to use what I have learned to better myself and those around me.
